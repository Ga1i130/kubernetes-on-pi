I'll try to install and configure a Kubernetes cluster completely from scratch. As a Hardware platform, I'm going to use my two raspberry pi's (3b &amp; 4)

# Used materials and hardware

- Rasp Pi 3B
- Pi Rack 
- Lan cable
- HDMI
- Vent

# Software
I'll use Ubuntu Server (not LTS) Version 20.4.

# Prevoius attempts to get the shit done
In the spring holidays, I've tried to install Kubernetes with de guide from a Youtube Tutorial. This was working well till an unknown (I've forgot it) error has destroyed the whole plan.
